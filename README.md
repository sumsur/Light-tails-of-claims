# Light-tail-of-claims
It is particularly important to describe the allocations that characterize or track the amounts of insurance claims. 
In doing so, it is important to distinguish between small claims and large claims. Minor indemnities are payments made by 
insurance companies which have the characteristic that each individual payment is negligible relative to the total indemnity, 
assuming that the number of payments is large. For such payments, distributions with a light (thin) tail are used. Large indemnities, 
on the other hand, imply payments whose value dominates the total amount of indemnity paid. For high-repayment modeling, appropriate 
distributions are with heavy (thick) tail.

#Here we have data for the Danube insurance company for the period 2007-2017.
What we can see here is that we have to deal with some seasonality. But appart from that through all period we have one LIGHT tail 
distribution of claims.

If you have some questions how I have made this conclusion please contact me, due to the fact that on another sublot I have just shown light 
tail distribution of some random data.
